Hi!

I am a postdoctoral researcher and scientific coordinator of the HBS doctoral programme “New Challenges in Ageing Societies” at TU Dortmund University. My research explores how health, well-being, and social inequality evolve across the life course and differ between societies. I am particularly interested in the intersections of aging, gender, socioeconomic inequalities, and social policy, and how these dimensions shape individual life chances in later life.

My work combines quantitative social research with a comparative perspective, examining how institutional contexts and welfare regimes influence patterns of health and inequality across countries.

Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to collaborate internationally, including research stays at Boston University, King’s College London, and the Vienna Institute of Demography. Before joining TU Dortmund, I worked as a project leader and research associate at the ISG Institute for Social Research in Cologne, where I contributed to several empirical studies.

My research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of how social policies can promote healthy and equitable aging in diverse societies.

My research has been recognized with several awards and competitive grants, including honors from the German Society for Gerontology and Geriatrics (DGGG), the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Sozialwissenschaftlicher Institute (ASI), and funding from the Daimler and Benz Foundation and the Minerva Stiftung.
