Below you find an overview of my research interests and topics of expertise. In each topic you find a short summary of my research, and the bibliography of selected publications within this field of research.​

## Socioeconomic and Gender Inequalities in Health Across the Life Course

[![How do socioeconomic and gendered factors shape health and well-being from midlife to old age? How do inequalities in health and well-being present across different contexts? My research examines the social and gendered determinants of health disparities and their implications for aging populations across Europe.](/images/healthinequalities.png)](/research/inequalities)

## Intergenerational Relations and Social Mobility

[![How do family relationships and intergenerational exchanges shape subjective and financial well-being in later life? What role does children’s upward educational mobility play in influencing the life satisfaction and health of their parents? This line of research connects family sociology with questions of inequality and life-course trajectories.](/images/mobility.jpg)](/research/mobility)

## Social Networks and Integration in Aging Societies

[![What enables or hinders older adults’ social participation and connectedness? How do gender, care responsibilities, and welfare systems influence patterns of integration, volunteering, and loneliness in later life? My work explores these questions through both national and cross-national lenses.](/images/aging.jpg)](/research/aging)

## Comparative Welfare State and Cross-national Research

[![How do welfare regimes and social policies shape inequalities in health, income, and social participation across Europe? How do institutional structures influence aging experiences and social integration? This research uses cross-national data to understand the role of policy contexts.](/images/comparative.jpg)](/research/cross-national)

## Policy Evaluations

[![My research contributes to evidence-based policy development in the areas of social inclusion, disability policy, and care systems. I conduct and co-author evaluations and reports that assess the implementation and impact of social policies and programs in Germany. These studies focus on improving quality standards in legal guardianship, enhancing early support for families, and promoting participation and equal opportunities for people with disabilities.](/images/healthpolicy.jpg)](/research/policy)
